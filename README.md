# tkinter-ui-design

eym_ui is a UI  design project that I've been preparing for library management project.

# installed pyinstaller for create dist file
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed your_app.py
```
This will create an executable file called your_app.exe in the same folder. You can then run this file on any Windows machine.
--onefile: This option creates a single executable file that contains all of the dependencies for your app.
--windowed: This option creates a windowed app that can be minimized and maximized.
--icon: This option specifies the icon that will be used for your app.
